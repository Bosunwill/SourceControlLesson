## IMPORTANT
Get the repository key in the class discussions (Canvas/Courses/Discussions).
I suppose you could create a basic python script and then just push it up with the key. Once pushed, go back to the repository on GitHub (here) and then click "Create Pull Request" and submit that. Once I see the changes I'll merge it with the repository.


# SourceControlLesson
Example source control lesson for class on Jan 25.

Order of Steps:

$ git clone https://github.com/JaredP45/SourceControlLesson

-- Add python file, make it print "Hello world"

$ git status

$ git add . 

$ git status

$ git commit -m "Added python file"

-- Get repository key 

$ git push origin main

- This will then ask for user name and password; get repository key from (Canvas/Courses/Discussions) then enter it here. It should then push, and you can then go to the github repository and submit a pull request. After that I can accept and merge the changes. -

$ git status
